In my abstract algebra class, we talked about one of the most beautiful theorems I've ever encountered: Cayley's theorem, which states that every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations. Turns out that no matter how abstract a group may seem, at its core, it can always be represented by something as concrete as permutations of elements. Next level of abstraction, but with such a clear way to understand its structure. Very cool!"},

It's familiar, which is nice, but I can feel that we're drifting apart. They focus so much on sports, which is cool, but I don't feel the same drive for it. I still have fun with them, but sometimes I feel like an observer in my own group. Is this just part of growing up? Realizing that the people who were 'your people' might not always be your people forever?"},
